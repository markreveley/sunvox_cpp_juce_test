Our goal is to create the most bare bones version of a vst plugin using the JUCE framework which contains DSP code from SunVox the tracker (included in repo.)

Objective #1:
Create the simplest possible JUCE plugin that loads

Objective #2:
Create the simplest possible variant of this initial loading plugin that loads the Sunvox DSP and emits a tone

reference research.md for notes from the developer of sunvox about the viability of this idea
